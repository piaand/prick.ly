## Project description
Pricky.ly is the worldâ€™s first hedgehog petting zoo. Hedgehog lovers may log into the service to reseach the wonderfull various kind of hedgehogs they would like to meet in person. User that is logged in may book a meeting time with one or more hedgehogs at the same time - given that the hedgehogs are available and not on holiday or booked by some other keen hogger.
